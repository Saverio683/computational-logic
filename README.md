# Computational Logic

This project was developed as part of the Computational Logic exam of my Artificial Intelligence degree program. The project received a grade of 30/30.

It aims to implement the fundamental concepts of computational logic.
It consists of three files:

1. **Proposition**: Contains implementations for manipulating logical propositions, enclosed in the *Proposition* class.
2. **Predicate**: It contains the *Term*, *Predicate* and *Model* classes. As the name implies they are used to handle the logic of predicates
3. **Main**: Here the classes are imported and the results are shown.
